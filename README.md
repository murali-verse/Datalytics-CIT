## Summary
This competition was a great platform to challenge myself and apply the concepts Iâ€™ve been learning in a real-world, competitive environment. The event was structured into three well-designed rounds:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We dove deep into raw data, uncovering patterns, insights, and anomalies to set the foundation for further modeling.

2. Machine Learning Model Building:
In this round, I built predictive models to solve the given problem statement, optimizing performance while ensuring interpretability.

3. PPT Presentation:
Finally, I presented my entire workflow, insights, and results to a panel of judges â€“ showcasing not only technical skills but also communication and storytelling

## Achievements
- Secured 3rd place among 100+ participants.
